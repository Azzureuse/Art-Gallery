        <p>Christ on the Cross is a 1627 oil painting on canvas by the Spanish painter Francisco de Zurbarán, now in the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>
        <p>In 1626 Zurbarán signed a new contract with the Dominicans of San Pablo de Real Monastery in Seville to produce 21 paintings in 8 months. One of these was Christ on the Cross, which was so admired by the artist's contemporaries that Seville's city council suggested he moved there permanently in 1629.</p>
        <p>As in Diego Velázquez's 1632 Christ Crucified, the artist shows Christ's two feet nailed separately – the number of nails used to crucify Christ was then a matter of controversy, with Bridget of Sweden writing of four nails. Both works also draw on a Counter Reformation trend after the Council of Trent to depictions focusing solely on Christ rather than those gathered around the cross.</p>
