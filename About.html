        <p class="description">
            This project will aim at designing a simple, fun, interactive site which will assist users to learn the basic French or Spanish language using arts. We would like to make language learning less formalized and more creative through the use of drawings, paintings, music and other activities based on art. The site will act as a platform through which the users will be able to study the lessons, learn new words and learn about the culture of the languages. We desire to offer the learners a comfortable and enjoyable environment to learn, express them and get motivated as they learn the language as well as the artistic aspects of French and Spanish arts.
